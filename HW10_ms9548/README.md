# HW10 Summary

#### The python notebook contains the spatial autocorrelation analysis for citibike data for all months considered in the data set, as well as selected winter and summer months.  The final results are presented below:

#### The results depicted in the images are relatively consisted, and this is to be expected despite analysis for seasonal variation.  Outer census tracts shown as cold spots, as these are census tracts adjacent to other census tracts with lower citibike rider statistics.  Lower Manhattan (i.e., south of central park) shows high spatial autocorrelation, again to be expected, as many citibike stations are concentrated there.  Red in the summer autocorrelation are more intense compared to winter, which is unsurprising as more ridership is expected during warmer months.
