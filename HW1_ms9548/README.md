This directory contains Matt Sloanes first submission for Homework 1, specifically "Assignment 2: Set Up Your Environment."
------
NOTE: I am submitting this homework early, as you requested, because I am normally a student in the Thursday Session, but will be attending 
the Tuesday Session this week (Week 2) because I am traveling.  On that note, I was having trouble with Assignment 2 (mostly the git
syntax), so it is incomplete.  I tried to go to office hours Monday afternoon at 2pm but realized I had no idea where they were and Sabreen
was not responsive over e-mail.  I didn't have much time to wait around as I work full time and have other things I need to attend to.  
I take full responsibility for the incompleteness however.
