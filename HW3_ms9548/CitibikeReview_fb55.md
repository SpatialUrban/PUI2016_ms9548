# Citibike mini project review by fb55

## IDEA: 
Start with the idea, and a description of the project, not with the data download. As it is stated the idea is very vague.



## Null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis: these are not formulated correctly because they do not really tell me what you are measuring. Particularly; the number of rides does not relate clearly at all to the use as commuters: there are many reasons why one may choose to subscribe or not, there are turists.... Do you meen weekdays as in not-weekend? if you do you need to state that. 

Null Hypothesis - Nonsubscribers use citibikes during the week as much as or more than subscribers
Alt Hypothesis - Subscribers are more likely to use citibikes during the week

You need to formulate the Null and alternative in words, and in a mathematical formula. e.g.:

*H_0: Something >= something else*

With a formulation of the Null and alternative as vague as the one you have this is not possible yet.

## data wrangling: 
there is not much there, but what is there seems correct: you separated costumers and subscribers, and counted trips. 

At this stage I cannot say if the data supports your experiment because I do not know what you want to measure.
I cannnot suggest a test though because I do not understand you experiment and what would indicate usage for communting an not for communting.
the data wrangling phase seems ok. It is very similar to what I did (down to the scheme for naming variables).
