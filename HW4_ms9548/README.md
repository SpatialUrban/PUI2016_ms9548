## Assignment 3
  
The "Hard to Employ" analysis was recreated using felony recidivism data from the same report.
  
Idea: Inmates participating in the hard to employ program who have been convicted of a felony are less likely to relapse into criminal behaviour (i.e., recidivism)

Null Hypothesis:  The percent of former prisoners convicted of a felony who relapse into crimininal behavior (i.e., recidivism) within 1 - 3 years after release is the same or higher for candidates who participated in the program as for the control group, significance level p = 0.05 (P1>= P0)

Alternative Hypothesis:  Ther percent of former prisoners convicted of a felony who relapse into criminal behavior (i.e, recidivism) within 1 - 3 years after relase is lower for candidates who participated in the program as for the control level, significance level  p = 0.05 (P1 < P0)

H0: P0 - P1 <= 0

H1: P0 - P1 > 0

Î± = 0.05

The z-Score was found to be be approximately ~ -0.8 - using the the Standard Normal Distribution Table (http://math.arizona.edu/~rsims/ma464/standardnormaltable.pdf) at a 0.05 significance, a value of 0.19766 was obtained, which was then subtracted from 1 to obtain the p-value, which was 0.80234.  This is larger than the significance threshold (0.05), and, therefore, the Null Hypothesis was not rejected.

Per the assignment, the data was also run through the Chi Square Evalution function provided by the professor, which x^2 value of 0.718493917505.  The x^2 probability at 1 degree of freedom at a 0.05 significance level is 3.84 (per the provided table: http://passel.unl.edu/Image/Namuth-CovertDeana956176274/chi-sqaure%20distribution%20table.PNG).  The x^2 distribution (0.72) is smaller than the probability threshold (3.84) and is therefore not significant at the 0.05 significance level.  And the null hypothesis is not rejected.

This finding should not be surprising - the program group and control group had a relatively similar sample size and the percentage of program participants that experienced recidivism within 1-3 years of release was comparable to its control group counterpart.  Thus, participation in the program had little impact on rates of recidivism.
