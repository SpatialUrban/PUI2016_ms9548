## Assignment 1

In this assignment, the age distribution for the June 2015 citibike data was tested as a normal and logistic distribution using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) and Anderson Darling (AD) tests.  Two Null Hypothesis were developed for each distribution and tested:

### Gaussian / Normal Distribution Null Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (HO): The data follows a normal / gaussian distribution
Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The data does not follow a normal / gaussian distribution
Significance Level - 0.05

Both the KS and AD goodness of fit tests demonstrated that their respective statistics exceeded their associated critical value at the 0.05 significance level, and therefore the Null Hypothesis is rejected.

### Logistic Distribution Null Hypothesis

Null Hypothesis (HO): The data follows a logistic distribution
Alternative Hypothesis (HA): The data does not follow a logistic distribution
Significance Level - 0.05

Both the KS and AD goodness of fit tests demonstrated that their respective statistics exceeded their associated critical value at the 0.05 significance level, and therefore the Null Hypothesis is rejected.

## Assignment 2

## Assignment 3

### Do diets help lose more fat than the exercise?

Diet - P0  (Test)

Exercise - P1 (Control)

Null Hypowthesis (HO): Exercise help lose just as much or more fat than dieting (P0 - P1 <= 0).

Alt Hypothesis (HA): Diets help lose more fat than exervise (P0 - P1 > 0).

### Do American trust the president?

Trust - P0

No Trust - P1

Null Hypothesis (HO): The number of Americans who do not trust the president is greater than or equal to those who do trust the president (P0 - P1 <= 0).

Alt Hypothesis (HA):  THe number of Americans who trust the president is greater than the number of Americans who do not trust the president (P0 - P1 > 0).

### Effectiveness of nicotine patches to quit smoking

Nictone Patch - P0

Placebo - P1

Null Hypothesis (HO): Smoking cessation rates among placebo recipients are equal to or greater than cessation rates among nicotine patch recipients (P0 - P1 <= 0).

Alt Hypothesis (HA): Cessation rates among nicotine patch users are greater than cessation rates among placebo recipients (P0 - P1 > 0).

### Quantify the danger of smoking for pregnant women.

IQ levels among 1 - 4 year olds whose mother smoked during pregnancy (P0)

IQ levels among 1 - 4 year olds whose mother did not smoke during pregnancy (P1)

Null Hypothesis (H0): IQ levels among 1-4 year olds whose mother smoked during pregnancy are greater than or equal to IQ levels of 1-4 year olds of mothers who did not smoke during pregnancy (P0 - P1 >= 0).

Alt Hypothesis (HA): IQ levels among 1-4 year olds whose mother smoked during pregnancy are less than the IQ levels of 1-4 year olds of mothers who did not smoke (P0 - P1 < 0).
